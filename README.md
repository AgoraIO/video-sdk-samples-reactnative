# Agora Video SDK for React Native reference app

This app demonstrates the use of [Agora's Video SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk) for real-time audio and video communication. It is a robust and comprehensive documentation reference app for React Native, designed to enhance your productivity and understanding. It's built to be flexible, easily extensible, and beginner-friendly.

Clone the repo, run and test the samples, and use the code in your own project. Enjoy.

## Samples

This reference app includes several samples that illustrate the functionality and features of Agora Video and Voice SDKs. Each sample is self-contained and the relevant code can be found in its own folder in the root directory. For more information about each sample, see:

- [SDK quickstart](./src/agora-manager/agoraManager.tsx)
- [Secure authentication with tokens](./src/authentication-workflow/authenticationWorkflow.tsx)
- [Call quality best practice](./src/ensure-call-quality/ensure-call-quality.tsx)

To view the UI implementation, open the relevant Activity Class file [here]( android-reference-app/app/src/main/java/io/agora/android_reference_app).


## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this reference app, ensure you have the following set up:

- [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- An IDE of your choice.
- An Agora account and project
- A computer with Internet access. Ensure that no firewall is blocking your network communication.

## Run the app

1. **Clone the repository**

    To clone the repository to your local machine, open Terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, use the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/video-sdk-samples-reactnative.git
    ```

1. **Open the project**

   Open your project in an IDE and launch a terminal. Then, install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```   

1. **Modify the project configuration**

   The app loads connection parameters from the [`config.json`](./src/agora-manager/config.ts) file. Ensure that the file is populated with the required parameter values before running the application.

    - `uid`: The user ID associated with the application.
    - `appId`: (Required) The unique ID for the application obtained from [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io). 
    - `channelName`: The default name of the channel to join.
    - `rtcToken`:An token generated for `channelName`. You generate a temporary token using the [Agora token builder](https://agora-token-generator-demo.vercel.app/).
    - `serverUrl`: The URL for the token generator. See [Secure authentication with tokens](authentication-workflow) for information on how to set up a token server.
    - `tokenExpiryTime`: The time in seconds after which a token expires.

    If a valid `serverUrl` is provided, all samples use the token server to obtain a token except the **SDK quickstart** project that uses the `rtcToken`. If a `serverUrl` is not specified, all samples except **Secure authentication with tokens** use the `rtcToken` from `config.json`.

1. **Build and run the project**

   - **For IOS**:
      
      1. Install CocoaPods:

         ```bash
          npx pod-install
         ```
      
      2. Run your project inside an IOS emulator:
       
         ```bash
         yarn run ios
         ```
   - **For Android**:
      
      1. Run your project inside an Android emulator
         
         ```bash
         yarn run android
         ```
         Ensure that you have configured a video device for your Android virtual machine.

1. **Run the samples in the reference app**

    From the main app screen, choose and launch a sample.
